## 🛡️ Zero Placeholder Policy (NO EXCUSES!)

- Every feature must be **fully functional** — no “demo”, “soon”, or “placeholder” buttons allowed.
- Any “✓” in project structure means **real, production-ready implementation**.
- Any “✗” is **not implemented** and must be added immediately (with real code, not UI only).
- If any non-working or fake feature is detected, the project is automatically **rejected**.
- Every feature uses **local, open-source AI (TabbyML/StarCoder2)**, never paid APIs.
- All branding, logos, and credits are clearly marked:  
  **by Knoux & Sadek Elgazar**
